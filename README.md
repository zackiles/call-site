A modern Deno 2 library starter kit with strongly typed CRUD operations and optional CLI, HTTP, and WebSocket interfaces for testing.

## Getting Started

If you just cloned this starter kit, run `deno run --allow-all template.ts`. It'll prompt you for various values to setup the repo and automatically configure it for you. It even uses default values retrieved from git to make it easy for you. If you make a mistake and want to reset you can run `deno run --allow-all template.ts --reset`.

üéâ **That's it!** You'll have a complete library package ready for publishing on JSR (use `deno task publish`).

**NOTE:** Running the template generator will replace this README.md. If you need to access it after, you can find it in `./templates/README.md.backup` or on [github.com/zackiles/deno-lib-starter](https://github.com/zackiles/deno-lib-template/blob/main/README.md).

```text
// A freshly cloned repo will have these template strings found throughout the code base:

{PACKAGE_NAME}
{PACKAGE_VERSION}
{PACKAGE_AUTHOR_NAME}
{PACKAGE_AUTHOR_EMAIL}

// Running "deno run template.ts" will replace them.
```

## Features

üöÄ **Guided Setup:** Quickly generate your next package with guided setup and intelligent defaults.
ü¶ñ **Modern Deno 2 Features:** Using the latest Deno 2 APIs and practices such as OpenTelemetry.
ü§ñ **AI-Native:** Includes a complete set of Deno-optimized AI triggers and meta prompts in `.cursor/rules` to jump-start your project.
üîí **Safe Defaults:** Achieve a 100% [JSR score](https://jsr.io/docs/scoring) with safe defaults and comprehensive TypeScript coverage.
üõ† **Optional Testing Tools:**
Accelerate development of library easily with an autogenerated CLI, HTTP Server, and WebSocket interface to consume and test the library.

- üîπ **CLI:** Automatically generates stdio command handlers for each function your library exposes.
- üåê **HTTP Server:** Automatically generates HTTP endpoints for each function your library exposes.
- ‚ö° **WebSocket Server:** Automatically generates JSON-RPC handlers for each function your library exposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.com/) v2.0 or newer
- **Note:** if you're building a browser-based library you will have to add additional libraries to `compilerOptions.lib` in `deno.jsonc` such as `dom` after you've generated to template. For more info see: [DenoDocs - CompilerOptions](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/ts_config_migration/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the template generator: `deno run template.ts`. The generate will walk you through configuring your library using the templates in `.templates/`.
