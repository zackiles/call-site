A modern, AI-Native, Deno 2 library starter kit with with CLI, HTTP, and WebSocket interfaces for easy testing of your library.

## Getting Started

If you just cloned this starter kit, run `deno task kit setup`. It'll prompt you for various values to setup the repo and automatically configure it for you. It even uses default values retrieved from git to make it easy for you. If you make a mistake and want to reset you can run `deno task kit reset`.

🎉 **That's it!** You'll have a complete working directory and library and package, and no longer need to use `deno-kit`, if you want, you can even remove the `.deno-kit` folder. Now explore the rest of the tasks in `deno.jsonc` and being development! Once you're ready to publish your library run `deno publish`.

**NOTE:** Running the template generator will replace this README.md. If you need to access it after, you can find it in `.deno-kit/templates/README.md.backup` or on [github.com/zackiles/deno-kit](https://github.com/zackiles/deno-kit/blob/main/README.md).

```text
// A freshly cloned repo will have these template strings found throughout the code base. All of them are optional. They are:


{PACKAGE_NAME}: Required. e.g "@scope/package-name". Determines {PACKAGE_SCOPE}
{PACKAGE_VERSION}: Defaults to 0.0.1
{PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION} Defaults to ""
{PACKAGE_GITHUB_USER}: Defaults to PACKAGE_SCOPE
{PACKAGE_AUTHOR_NAME}: Defaults to "git config user.name"
{PACKAGE_AUTHOR_EMAIL}: Defaults to "git config user.email"

// Running "deno task kit setup" will replace them.
```

## Features

🚀 **Guided Setup:** Quickly setup your next package with guided setup and intelligent defaults.

🦖 **Modern Deno 2 Features:** Using the latest Deno 2 APIs and practices such as OpenTelemetry.

🤖 **AI-Native:** Includes a complete set of Deno-optimized AI triggers and meta prompts in `.cursor/rules` to jump-start your project.
🔒 **Safe Defaults:** Achieve a 100% [JSR score](https://jsr.io/docs/scoring) with safe defaults and comprehensive TypeScript coverage.

🛠 **Optional Testing Tools:**
Accelerate development of library easily with an autogenerated CLI, HTTP Server, and WebSocket interface to consume and test the library.

- 🔹 **CLI:** Automatically generates stdio command handlers for each function your library exposes.
- 🌐 **HTTP Server:** Automatically generates HTTP endpoints for each function your library exposes.
- ⚡ **WebSocket Server:** Automatically generates JSON-RPC handlers for each function your library exposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.com/) v2.0 or newer
- **Note:** if you're building a browser-based library you will have to add additional libraries to `compilerOptions.lib` in `deno.jsonc` such as `dom` after you've generated to template. For more info see: [DenoDocs - CompilerOptions](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/ts_config_migration/)

### Installation

1. Create a new repository from this template (or just clone it you don't have the gh CLI):

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh repo create your-project-name --template zackiles/deno-kit

# Or use the GitHub web interface
# Visit https://github.com/zackiles/deno-kit
# Click the "Use this template" button > "Create a new repository"
```

2. Clone your new repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
cd your-project-name
```

3. Run the template generator: `deno task kit setup`. Deno-kit will walk you through configuring your library using the templates in `.deno-kit/templates/`.
